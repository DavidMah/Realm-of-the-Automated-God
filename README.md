# Realm Of the Automated God

https://github.com/DavidMah/Realm-of-the-Automated-God

Realm of the Automated God is a Bot that plays Realm of the Mad God. 

**Unfortunately, t's really janky and I'm certain that you won't be able
to get it to work on your machine without many hours of work. This is because
it was made for the purpose of tinkering with and showing the worth of the Robot.java 
library, and that task is a success**

# Instructions

Run `Runner` with java

Within five seconds, place your mouse pointer at the top left
of the main gameplay square of Realm of the Mad God. The program will
report to stdout when it has confirmed the top left coordinate. Then
within three seconds, place the mouse pointer at the bottom right of the
main gameplay square. The bot will confirm the bottom right coordinate
and take control of the mouse/keyboard.

# Extension

One can extend UserCharacter.java to create a different bot. MadGod.java
handles the scanning of game data from your screen and Runner passes it
to UserCharacter.
